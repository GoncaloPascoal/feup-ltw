**7.** An HTTP session consists in the client sending a request to the server, which then processes that request and sends a response back to the client with a specific response code.
Since no information is stored on the server after the request has been fulfilled, we can say that HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means previous requests can't influence the responses to subsequent requests.  
**8.** Validate XML files
